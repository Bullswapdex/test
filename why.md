  # Why choose BullSwap?



  The cryptocurrency market has experienced significant growth and innovation in recent years, and BRC-20 tokens have become an important part of this space.
Over 8,800 BRC-20 tokens have been launched with a combined market capitalization of over $137 million. This rapid growth has resulted in increased interest and investments in the industry. However, the expanding ecosystem highlights the need for efficient trading platforms tailored to the unique requirements of BRC-20 tokens.
The Ordinals protocol lays the foundation for the development of BRC-20 tokens, bringing several advantages to the market. Some of these benefits include:

Supports the creation of unique and innovative token concepts that attract a wide variety of investors and users to the ecosystem.


Breathe new life into the Bitcoin network by bringing in new stakeholders with different perspectives, driving innovation and increasing market interest.


The security of the Bitcoin network is strengthened by incentivizing miners through higher transaction fees resulting from increased transaction activity.


As the growth of BRC-20 tokens leads to wider adoption and interest in the Ordinals protocol, it may facilitate a cultural shift within the Bitcoin community.

Therefore, there is a need for a decentralized exchange (DEX) that can effectively facilitate the trading and liquidity provision of BRC-20 tokens, taking full advantage of the advantages provided by the Ordinals protocol.
Overview of BullSwap's goals
BullSwap aims to meet the growing demand for a reliable, user-friendly and secure trading platform dedicated to the BRC-20 ecosystem.
Bullswap uses an API router to initiate transfers for traders, and the API scripts are written in a decentralized manner without giving any power to deployers or wallet owners! !
Due to the nature of Bitcoin Ordinals, there is no such thing as a contract that runs against code (e.g. Uniswap), so the only possible way to enable BRC20 transactions is through the API.
Using the API is the only viable option! API Wallet automatically processes all transactions according to the code, and provides security measures and multiple confirmations for each transaction to prevent errors and loss of funds.
Providing solutions to increase liquidity, BullSwap will eventually become the most powerful presence in the growing market that cannot be ignored.
