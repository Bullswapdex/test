#  solution


BullSwap has created BRC20's native DEX, and is the first aggregator in the BRC20 ecosystem that combines order book and AMM functions, providing users with a complete solution for the most convenient trading experience.
Liquidity providers create markets by depositing two tokens of equal value Token combinations can include Bitcoin with one BRC-20 token or two BRC-20 tokens
The funds in these pools are usually BTC but this is not mandatory
In return, liquidity providers receive “liquidity tokens” that represent their share of the overall liquidity pool. These liquidity tokens can be exchanged for their share in the pool.
