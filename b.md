   # BRC20



   # What are BRC-20 tokens on Bitcoin?
The BRC-20 token standard is an experimental fungible token standard for Bitcoin created by Twitter user, @domodata on March 8th, 2023.

It utilizes Ordinal inscriptions of JSON data to deploy token contracts, mint tokens, and transfer tokens.The name, “BRC-20” is a play on Ethereum’s ERC-20 token standard, although BRC-20 is much simpler and is constrained due to the limitations of the Bitcoin blockchain. You can read more about the details of the token standard here or here.

And as the creator has noted, it’s just an experiment and the tokens are not intended to be worth anything–though degen speculators may see it differently…

First BRC-20 Token (ordi)
The first token contract deployed was for the “ordi” token, with a limit of 1,000 tokens per mint and 21,000,000 tokens total.Ordinal wallets such as Unisat were quick to deploy tooling for the BRC-20 standard, and in less than 18 hours, all 21,000,000 ordi tokens had been minted, with pending mints for an additional 1,500,000 ordi tokens that were not within the limit.This tooling also contributed to the deployment of other BRC-20 tokens, with names like “meme,” “punk,” and “doge”–with the excitement around BRC-20 leading to over 30,000 Ordinal inscriptions in a single day: a record number.Much to the chagrin of some Bitcoiners, it also massively increased Bitcoin transaction fees.
#   What’s next for BRC-20?
The community–and builders like Unisat–seem to be running with the BRC-20 standard even though the creator has pointed out repeatedly that it’s just an experiment, it has issues, and the tokens may not be worth anything.

Update: You can now buy and sell BRC-20 tokens in the Ordswap Discord with escrow.

So while there’s room for improvement and a better standard, it’s likely that we’ll see tooling to index and manage BRC-20 tokens better as well as more degenerate speculation from users. Users could ascribe value to BRC-20 tokens even if a better standard is deployed.

#  What would be required for a better standard?

For one, being able to distribute tokens in the deploy transaction (e.g. to the token founder). Another thing that has come up on Twitter is using a data structure that wouldn’t consume as much block space as JSON.FWIW, the creator of BRC-20 has expressed interest in developing a better fungible token standard on Bitcoin, so we may see these things come to fruition.
